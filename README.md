Welcome to your Intercom Hello World app
=================

Click `Show` in the header to show the live version of the app. For now it will only contain some URLs which you will need which creating app in Intercom.

We will create a simple app which lets you add a button component to the Messenger. You can then use this to add in more functinoality and start tinkering with the full potential of Intercom apps to better understand how they can be used for your unique use cases.

**Glitch** is the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.

Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
